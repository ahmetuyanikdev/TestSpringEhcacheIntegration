1.A gradle project with groupid and artifact id (Identifier with artifact id accross maven repositories) has been created
Some Exploretions  *
 after project opens on idea, the default src/main/java project structure was not available,
 actully apply java plugin is in place, and projcet structure should have been create accordingly
 ,and I tried to apply war plugin, it created src/main/webapp and that was not what I am looking for
 So I decided to re create the project,there was checkbox at the configuration level saying create empty directories...
 I checked that and structure was in place
 .
